Question 1:
Yes. Provide the Unity project to the Codex cloud agent, install a headless-capable Unity Editor (for example, version 2022.3.34f1), and launch the editor with `-batchmode -nographics -runTests -testPlatform playmode`. The Unity Test Framework will then discover and execute Play Mode assemblies, writing XML and log output without requiring a windowed session.

Question 2:
`SetupScript.txt` contains a Bash automation that installs the Unity 2022.3.34f1 editor, pulls in the required Ubuntu 24.04 libraries, wires an optional license file, and emits a `/usr/local/bin/run-unity-playmode-tests` helper so the Codex cloud agent can trigger Play Mode tests from any Unity project directory.
