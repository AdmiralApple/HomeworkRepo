Question 1:
Yes. The Codex cloud agent can execute Unity Play Mode test cases as long as the repository supplies the Unity project and the environment provides a headless-capable Unity Editor. By installing the Unity 2022.3.34f1 editor, granting the agent execute permissions, and invoking the Unity test runner with the appropriate flags (for example, `-runTests -testPlatform playmode`), the agent can drive Play Mode tests from the command line. Ensure the project uses a Unity Test Framework-supported configuration and that any platform-specific dependencies (graphics, audio, GPU) are either stubbed or run through supported headless substitutes so the automated session can complete without manual interaction.

Question 2:
See SetupScript.txt for a Bash script that prepares the Codex cloud agent environment so it can invoke Unity 2022.3.34f1 in headless mode and run Play Mode tests via the Unity Test Framework.
